            <h1>Modelling Diagrams</h1>
            <p>As I said previously, this is a notebook, so I apologize in advance for any lack of structure.</p>
<p>Diagrams are a big part of almost any type of systems analysis. This can mean anything from a sketch or mind-map on a notepad, to highly structure graph analysis or UML block diagrams. Various disciplines have come up with their own versions of these, to varying degrees of formality.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’m interested in learning more about tools that I can use to analyze fuzzy, complex systems, that are usually a mix of social and physical systems. A lot of what’s termed “systems theory” can either slide off into the simplistic or the overly technical, and the diagramming languages are no exception. For the purposes of discussion, I’ll do a little bit of back-of the envelope modelling of something I’m interested in, and show how diagram/mapping techniques can be applied to tease out some thinking.</p>
<p>One one end of the spectrum, we have mind mapping or ad-hoc dynamics maps. Pick a system of interest- for instance, the</p>
